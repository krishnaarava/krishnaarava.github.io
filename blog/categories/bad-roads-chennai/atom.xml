If you happened to be in Chennai,India do not ever get on to IT express corridor way. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I was to taking it everyday to reach office. Not just me, an estimated 2 lakh people take it everyday to reach their destination. This expressway is the only way to reach SIPCOT SEZ (special economic zone / IT hub. Believe it or not this place was once dump yard .. yak!) This expressway is dirty stretch of 20 Kms from Thirvanmayur to Siruseri, with incomplete roads and footpaths.  <br/><br/>This dirty stretch has incomplete encroached footpaths, roads layed without any special U turn approach roads and constant straying of cows and dogs<br/><br/>Yet to use this way four wheeler owner needs to pay 35 rupees for using this way. It kind of shows how much poor governance is part of bureaucratic system in India.</div>
